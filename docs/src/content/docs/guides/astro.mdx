title: How to use with Astro
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

I'm currently working on making an importable component accessible at `code-cage/astro`, I'd like to have the styling story figured out first.

In the mean time, creating an `.astro` wrapper can be done by following the below code snippet. For this example, we're going to use the Starlight theme's `<Code>` component. Feel free to use whatever syntax highlighter you are currently using, as long as it outputs HTML it should work.

```astro
---
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
interface Props {
    html: string;
    css: string;
    js: string;
}
---
<code-cage use-slots>
    <span slot="html"><Code code={Astro.props.html} lang="html" /></span>
    <span slot="css"><Code code={Astro.props.css} lang="css" /></span>
    <span slot="js"><Code code={Astro.props.js} lang="js" /></span>
</code-cage>
<script>
import { define } from 'code-cage';
define();
</script>
```

Then use it as you would any other `.astro` component.

```.astro
---
import CodeCage from './components/CodeCage.astro';

const serverRenderedHTMLString = `<div>
    ...
</div>`;
---
<CodeCage
    html={serverRenderedHTMLString}
    css=".test {
    color: limegreen;
}"
    js="(function() {
    console.log('testing');
})();"
/>
```

  As you can see, multiline content works in the attributes, but you have to
  adjust the spacing.
